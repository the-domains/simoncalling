An Elizabethan adage affirmed that 'Truth is truth, to the end of reckoning'. The author is William Shakespeare, and even when it looks like a positivist maxim, is not, since he was not a positivist nor a scientist. That has been brought up for a reason. The truth, the reality, the real world, are challenging matters broadly discussed by both scientists and thinkers, mainly under the scope of Empiricism and Rationalism. Nevertheless, it is reflected in the definition of Science nowadays. It has been defined as comprised group of interconnected allegoric statements, meaning that when there's a discussion about facts and theories, data and assumptions, the very real world is not the subject of it, but a set of descriptions and propositions concerning the world (Jan 

_et al_

, 1977). That being said, it's proper to add that Natural Sciences and Social Sciences, are clearly not the same (Giddens and Sutton, 2014). Thus, mathematics, astronomy, physics, chemistry, biology and so on, must be distinguished from anthropology, economics, geography, history, political science, psychology and sociology, making noticeably that Social Science tries to study the operation of social life (Smith, 1998) or social world, to ultimately discover the truth.

The Social Science scientific inquiry, works within 'a set of taken-for-granted assumptions' (Smith, 1998, p.15), founding difficulty in separate cultural values from the study of facts, with an interest of founding knowledge from previous studies and within a particular framework, cultural or institutional. Is in this part of the narrative where some aspects of the scientific inquiry must be stressed, specifically the early scientific method of the sometimes-bewildering Positivism. This term has changed over time and essentially grown thanks to a complex pathway walked, from the early positivism, to logical positivism, and finally to the standard positivism of today (Crotty, 1998). 

There is a 'triumvirate of thinkers' torchbearers' positivists (Jones, 2001, p.1) considered as the founding fathers of one of the most important ramifications of Social Sciences called Sociology, and they are: Comte, Spencer and Durkheim. Based on the early positivism, moreover in the fact that Emile Durkheim is one of the most important positivists (Lukes, 1973; Jones, 2001) in the history of Social Science, this essay will critically assess his contribution to modern Social Science Enquiry, examining the arguments for and against his thought, determining the value of its strengths and weaknesses, and enhancing it with a revision of his most important contributions within his five major works, despite the vast opprobrium he received and the affirmation that 'Durkheim now evokes all that must be avoided in sociology' (Jones, 2001, p.1), even when there's no room in this essay to deal with the whole array of theories from his major works, a reconsideration of his key-theories, is timely and even necessary, to further development of the current state of social sciences, ultimately demonstrating how Durkheim's ideas are quite persuasive and influential in the development of modern Social Science Inquiry. 

One of the first things that springs to the mind once the surnames 'Comte, Spencer, Durkheim' has been read, is the notion of Positivism, and according to Pyle (2006), it's a view that human knowledge is controlled by Empiricism and its relations, refusing metaphysical guesswork. In the fullness of time, the definitions have changed, but are still attached as closely as ever to Empiricism (Blaikie in Smith, 1998). In the same context, the latter can be defined as a philosophy that claim any genuine knowledge as testable by experience, 'through observation or experiment' (Benton and Craib, 2001, p.14).

However, there's another thing that comes attached to those three surnames, and that's Sociology. That, can be defined as a 'social science that studies human interactions', social relations, social changes and societal disorders (The Editors of Encyclopaedia Britannica, 2015). Therefore, a concept association outcome is the notion of Positivist Sociology, a practise seeking to create 'causal explanations or to search for fundamental laws of human behaviour' (Halfpenny, 2014, p.11) insisting in empirical data collected to build or evaluate hypotheses. This is the environment where Durkheim cultivated his ideas. 

In order to understand Durkheim, his historical background must be brought up. The turbulent time in which he lived (Parkin, 1992) clearly stimulated men's minds. He was French and lived the decadence of Napoleon III's Empire, the birth of the Third French Republic and its struggles between the Royalists and Republicans, Church and Anticlericalism (Jones and Turner, 1986; Parkin, 1992). Durkheim himself was a Republican and a 'non-believer fascinated by religion' (Parkin, 1992, p.6), with strong Jewish roots, coming from a family of rabbis, therefore suffering the ensuing anti-Semitism of the French people. He introduced the study of Sociology in France as an answer to all these tribulations and changes, and as he wrote in 1900 'it was necessary to know what this nature of things was; consequently, the urgent need for a science of societies made itself felt without delay' (Durkheim in Jones and Turner, 1986, p.12). Evidently, his ideas had a passion for social reform and social understanding, a typical encapsulation of the positivist perspectives shaped by the Enlightenment (Crotty, 1998). Emile Durkheim lived from 1858 to 1917 and his Major works were: The Division of Labour in Society, The Rules of Sociological Method, Suicide, The Elementary Forms of Religious Life, Sociology and Philosophy (Abraham, 1973). 

The fundamental
base of Durkheim's theory lies in his concept of Social Facts. This is
explained by Ritzer (1995, p.215) as 'the Heart' of his ideas. Durkheim
classified social facts as material and nonmaterial, highlighting the
importance of nonmaterial social facts
